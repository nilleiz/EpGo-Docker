# EpGo Docker Image

A robust, secure, and multi-arch Docker image for **[EpGo](https://github.com/Chuchodavids/EpGo)**, a command-line tool for downloading television listings from Schedules Direct.

This image is built from source, ensuring compatibility with any Docker host architecture. It includes an intelligent entrypoint script to handle initial configuration and can be run either on a cron schedule or as a one-time task.

---

## ‚úÖ Features

* **Multi-Arch**: Built from source to run on any Docker host (amd64, arm64, etc.).
* **Flexible Execution**: Run `epgo` on a cron schedule or as a single, one-off task.
* **Secure**: Runs the application as a non-root `app` user.
* **Auto-Initialization**: Creates a default `config.yaml` on the first run.
* **Small Footprint**: Uses a multi-stage build to create a minimal final image.

---

## üöÄ Quick Start

This image is controlled via environment variables in your `docker-compose.yaml` file.

1.  Create a directory for your project:
    ```bash
    mkdir epgo-stack
    cd epgo-stack
    ```

2.  Create a `docker-compose.yaml` file with the following content. **Remember to **choose one execution mode**.

    ```yaml
    # docker-compose.yaml
    services:
      epgo:
        image: nillivanilli0815/epgo:latest
        container_name: epgo
        environment:
          - TZ=America/Chicago
          # --- CHOOSE ONE EXECUTION MODE ---

          # Option 1: Run on a schedule (e.g., every day at 2:00 AM)
          # The container will stay running as a cron daemon.
          - CRON_SCHEDULE=0 2 * * *

          # Option 2: Run just once and then stop the container.
          # - RUN_ONCE=true

        volumes:
          # This maps a local folder to the container for persistent data
          - ./epgo_data:/app
        
        # For CRON_SCHEDULE, 'unless-stopped' is recommended.
        # For RUN_ONCE, you might change this to 'no' if you don't want it to restart.
        restart: unless-stopped
    ```

3.  Start the container:
    ```bash
    docker compose up -d
    ```

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Execution Modes

You must set one of the following environment variables. `RUN_ONCE` takes priority if both are set.

### Cron Schedule Mode
Set the `CRON_SCHEDULE` variable to run `epgo` on a schedule. The container will run continuously as a cron daemon. Any output from `epgo` will be sent to the container's logs.

* **Example**: `CRON_SCHEDULE: "0 2 * * *"` runs the task every day at 2:00 AM.

### Run Once Mode
Set `RUN_ONCE: "true"` to execute the `epgo` command one time. The container will exit after the task is complete.

* **Note on `restart` policy**: If you use `RUN_ONCE` with `restart: unless-stopped`, the container will run, stop, and then immediately restart, creating a loop. For a true one-time run, you should change the restart policy to `restart: "no"`.

---

## üîß Interactive Configuration

To use the tool's built-in interactive configuration wizard, run the following command. This will start a temporary container to guide you through the setup.

```bash
docker compose run --rm epgo epgo -configure /app/config.yaml
```


## ‚ö†Ô∏è A Note on Permissions
The entrypoint script will automatically change the ownership of the files in your host directory (./epgo_data) to the app user from inside the container. This may cause the folder on your host to appear to be owned by a different user (e.g., dhcpcd or 100). This is expected and is required for the non-root user in the container to be able to write the config and XMLTV files.

# Original README

## Features

- Cache function to download only new EPG data
- No database is required
- Update EPG with CLI command for using your own scripts

## Requirements

- [Schedules Direct](https://www.schedulesdirect.org/ "Schedules Direct") Account
- Computer with 1-2 GB memory
- [Go](https://golang.org/ "Golang") to build the binary
- [Optional] Docker to run it in a dockerize environment

## Installation

### Option 1 -- Build Binary

The following command must be executed with the terminal / command prompt inside the source code folder.  

```bash
go mod tidy
go build epgo
```

This will spit out a binary for your OS named `epgo`

### Option 2 -- Docker

I need to set up the docker image. However, you can build your own by running:

#### **docker-compose**

clone this repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Chuchodavids/EpGo.git
```

```docker-compose
services:
    epgo:
      container_name: epgo
      build: .
      environment:
        - TZ=America/Chicago
      volumes:
        - YOUR_CONFIG.YAML_FOLDER:/app/
      restart: always
```

### Option 3 -- download binary

go to [releases](https://github.com/Chuchodavids/EpGo/releases) and download the needed version

## Using the APP

```epgo -h```

```bash
-config string
    = Get data from Schedules Direct with configuration file. [filename.yaml]
-configure string
    = Create or modify the configuration file. [filename.yaml]
-version
    = shows the current version
-h  : Show help
```

### Create a config file

**note**: You can use the sample config file that is in the /config folder inside of the docker container

```epgo -configure MY_CONFIG_FILE.yaml```  
If the configuration file does not exist, a YAML configuration file is created. 

**Configuration file from version 1.0.6 or earlier is not compatible.**  

#### Terminal Output

```txt
Configuration [MY_CONFIG_FILE.yaml]
-----------------------------
 1. Schedules Direct Account
 2. Add Lineup
 3. Remove Lineup
 4. Manage Channels
 5. Create XMLTV File [MY_CONFIG_FILE.xml]
 0. Exit
```

##### Follow the instructions in the terminal

1. Schedules Direct Account:  
Manage Schedules Direct credentials.  

2. Add Lineup:  
Add Lineup into the Schedules Direct account.  

3. Remove Lineup:  
Remove Lineup from the Schedules Direct account.  

4. Manage Channels:  
Selection of the channels to be used.
You can now choose to add all channels from a lineup at once or select them individually.
All selected channels are merged into one XML file when the XMLTV file is created.
When using all channels from all lineups it is recommended to create a separate epgo configuration file for each lineup.  
5. Create XMLTV File [MY_CONFIG_FILE.xml]:  
Creates the XMLTV file with the selected channels.  

**Example:**

Lineup 1:

```bash
epgo -configure Config_Lineup_1.yaml
```

Lineup 2:

```bash
epgo -configure Config_Lineup_2.yaml
```

  </rating>
   ...
</programme>
```

**false:** TV parental guidelines are not used. Further rating settings are ignored.  

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<programme channel="epgo.67203.schedulesdirect.org" start="20200509134500 +0000" stop="20200509141000 +0000">

```yaml
Rating:
        ...
        Maximum rating entries. 0 for all entries: 1
        ...
```

Specifies the number of maximum rating entries. If the value is 0, all parental guidelines available from Schedules Direct are used. Depending on the preferred countries.

```yaml
Rating:
        ...
        Preferred countries. ISO 3166-1 alpha-3 country code. Leave empty for all systems:
          - DEU
          - CHE
          - USA
        ...
```

Sets the order of the preferred countries [ISO 3166-1 alpha-3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-3 "ISO 3166-1 alpha-3").  
Parental guidelines are not available for every country and program information. Trial and error.  
If no country is specified, all available countries are used. Many clients ignore a list with more than one entry or use the first entry.  

**If no country is specified:**  
If a rating entry exists in the same language as the Schedules Direct Lineup, it will be set to the top. In this example German (DEU).  

Lineup: **DEU**-1000097-DEFAULT  
1st rating system (Germany): Freiwillige Selbstkontrolle der Filmwirtschaft  

```xml
...
<rating system="Freiwillige Selbstkontrolle der Filmwirtschaft">
